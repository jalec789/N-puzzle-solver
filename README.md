# 8 Puzzle Solver
## Introduction
Hello, I am Jason Chan and this repo will showcase the optimalities of an A* algorithm.

## What is it

This program can perform uniform cost search, A* misplaced tiles, and A* manhattan distance search to solve 8 puzzles but could also solve n puzzles if need be. We can benchmark the algorithms against eachother for different 8-puzzle boards to weigh each algorithm's pros and cons.

## Dependencies
Java, just build with java...

## How to Run
This is a less formal way to build but the quick version is
```
cd src
javac eightPuzzle.java
java eightPuzzle
```
Then just follow the menu items on the screen.
